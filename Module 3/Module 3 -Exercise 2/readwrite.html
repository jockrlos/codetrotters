             <p>The tech industry's diversity problems are exacerbated by its obsession with genius coders and brilliant founders, Carissa Romero, a partner at the diversity consulting startup Paradigm, said today at TechCrunch Disrupt NY. <br><br>Romero, who took part in a panel of diversity advocates, said that the mentality that geniuses are born rather than created through experience and practice can be alienating for people who don't fit the stereotype of the average tech worker: young, white, straight male, probably rocking a hoodie. <br><br>Diversity - or the lack of it - became a major focus in tech several years ago when companies like Google and Facebook followed Pinterest's lead and released hard data about the gender and racial makeup of their workforces. <br><br>The numbers confirmed the well-worn stereotype that tech companies are mostly staffed by white men, and kicked off conversations about how to level the playing field. But now, those conversations have started to shift. <br><br>With hard data out on the table, companies have started to diversify their new hires and are beginning to focus on building inclusive cultures so they can retain staff. <br><br>Erica Baker, an engineer and diversity advocate at Slack, and Danielle Brown, head of diversity and inclusion at Intel, joined Romero in that conversation today at TechCrunch Disrupt NY.</p>

             <p>You never know what you're going to get when you sit down with Parrot CEO Henri Seydoux. The executive is every bit as unpredictable as the company he runs - and just like Parrot's products, he always puts on a good show. <br><br> Seydoux's panel at Disrupt today was largely focused on the company's drone business, but took some interesting zigs and zags along the way, particularly toward the end when he let the audience in on some of his more interesting plans for the future, including a rethink of one of the most ubiquitous articles of clothing out there. <br><br> "I am working on a t-shirt," Seydoux told the audience toward the end of the conversation. "I've been working on it for two years." The executive added that he hoped to be showcasing the product at this event a few years from now. <br><br>Seydoux didn't offer much in the way of specifics, due most likely to the project's relative infancy, but added confidently, "I'm working on a t-shirt that youâ€™ve never seen before." <br><br> The exec confirmed the product backstage - we mostly just wanted to make sure we were hearing things right, given Parrot's previous focus on drones, audio accessories and you know, things that aren't t-shirts.</p>

             <p>If Nearpod CEO Guido Kovalskys has his way, overhead projectors and PowerPoint presentations will never bore students again. Instead, he wants to see cutting-edge technologies and interactive content become standard tools of the teaching trade. <br><br>To that end, Nearpod has raised $9.2 million in Series A funding led by Reach Capital to help teachers use mobile tech for live instruction, rather than telling their students to put their phones away. <br><br> Kovalskys says, "Seventy to eighty percent of high school students in the U.S. have their own smartphone. And forty percent of students have some sort of access to mobile devices in class through school programs alone." <br><br>Nearpod's app lets teachers deliver digital lessons to students right on their mobile devices, during class.</p>

             <p>Image management and distribution platform Musikki raised a first round of funding in 2014 to become "the IMDB of music". It's now inked a deal on another $1M in funding from Portugal Ventures, the biggest VC in Portugal. <br><br>It's also launching Exclusiph, an image management and distribution tool for the music industry, already in use by independent labels 4AD and Secretly Group. Exclusiph enables the distribution of images to any channel with one file upload. This then automatically generates the image for print, as a digital download, and allows it to be embedded online. Credits, music metadata and related content like press releases, video and audio links can all be added to the image file. That makes it a useful tool for album promotion. <br><br>Right now London-based Musikki competes with Allmusic, Discovr, Echonest and Rovi on the data and B2B side. <br><br>The tool was developed in conjunction with independent label 4AD and is now being used by labels like Secretly Group, which features artists like Destroyer and Sharon Van Etten.</p>
